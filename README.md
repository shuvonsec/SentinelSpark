# SentinelSpark

**Tagline:** Train Smart. Click Safe.

SentinelSpark is a cybersecurity awareness and phishing simulation platform designed to make security training engaging, measurable, and affordable. We help organizations transform their employees from the weakest security link into the first line of defense by combining realistic phishing simulations with instant coaching and bite-sized lessons.

## The Problem

- Phishing and social engineering attempts bombard every company, every day.
- Employees often cannot distinguish legitimate emails from malicious ones.
- Traditional cybersecurity training relies on dry slide decks that learners skip through and forget.
- The outcome is costly: 90% of data breaches originate from a human click, and SMBs lose billions to phishing each year.
- Existing enterprise tools are expensive and overly complex for smaller teams.
